        <h2>Key Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you make a suggestion to your students, and it gets judged, take ownership by making it clear it was
                your idea.</li>
            <li>Stay consistent in your expectations, feedback, and behavior—it helps students feel secure and focused.
            </li>
            <li>When assigning work, be clear and timely with all the necessary details and deadlines.</li>
            <li>Avoid last-minute tasks or requirements—keep communication transparent from the beginning.</li>
            <li>Act as a mentor, not an opponent. Be on their side and show that you genuinely care about their growth.
            </li>
            <li>Demonstrate your expertise—share why you’re a reliable source and why your insights matter.</li>
            <li>Always try to support your students—your role is to help them succeed, not just to grade them.</li>
            <li>When giving feedback, start with something positive to create a constructive atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Keep your tone motivating and encouraging—even critical feedback can be delivered with care.</li>
            <li>Make sure your students feel you’re invested in their success, not just tolerating them.</li>
            <li>If a disagreement arises, support your argument with realistic examples, not hypotheticals.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your tone—use authority only when it’s truly necessary, not as a default.</li>
            <li>Empathize—try to understand your students’ perspectives and challenges.</li>
            <li>Respect and value student input—don't impose your views as the only valid ones.</li>
            <li>Be approachable and human—students are more likely to open up and learn when they feel safe.</li>
            <li>Promote collaboration over competition to create a more inclusive environment.</li>
        </ul>
